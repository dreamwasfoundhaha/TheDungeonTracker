⚔️ The Dungeon Tracker



The Dungeon Tracker is a high-performance, lightweight utility mod for Hypixel Skyblock. Designed for efficiency and style, it automatically captures your Catacombs data and presents it in a sleek, customizable dashboard.



🚀 Key Features

• ⚡ Instant Detection: Zero-latency chat scraping catches your Floor, Score, Rank, and Time the moment the boss is defeated.

• 📂 Smart Filtering: One-click toggle between "Recent Runs" and specific "Floor Mode" (Entrance through M7).

• 🌈 RGB Fun Mode: A custom-built rainbow engine that animates the GUI headers, lines, and buttons.

• 🖱️ Advanced Scrolling: Full support for mouse-wheel scrolling and a draggable visual scrollbar for long grinding sessions.

• 🛡️ Silent Duplicate Filter: Custom logic to prevent Hypixel’s double-chat packets from creating ghost entries.



🛠 Installation

Warning:



I worked on this project as a time killer, and there could be some mistakes in the mod, and one thing is that when you close the game, your entire run history gets cleared. I will add a save-to-file feature in the next update. Till then, give your suggestions on my GitHub page for this mod.



Thank you for using my mod.
